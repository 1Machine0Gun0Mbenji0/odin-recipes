        <h1>CASSAVA</h1>
        <img src="../pictures/cassava.png" height="500px" width="1250px">
        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>This dish features perfectly medium-rare roasted beef, sliced to showcase its juicy pink center with a well-seasoned, caramelized crust on the exterior. The beef is accompanied by golden-brown fried cassava pieces that have a crispy exterior and soft interior, similar to thick-cut potato wedges but with cassava's distinctive starchy texture. Both components are arranged on a rustic wooden serving board with a juice groove, highlighting the contrast between the tender meat and the crispy cassava. The warm lighting accentuates the rich colors of the dish - the golden-yellow of the cassava and the gradient of brown to pink in the beef slices. This simple yet satisfying plate combines the hearty flavors of roasted meat with the comforting starchiness of fried cassava.</p>
